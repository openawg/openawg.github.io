title: openAWG participates in Human Rights Council Youth Forum at the UN
---

On 10 June 2016, we joined around 100 young leaders from around the globe at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland to help facilitate a Youth Forum. For the first time, this provided youth 18-30 a formal input to the 32<sup>nd</sup> session of the Human Rights Council.

Participants worked in serveral workgroups covering:

- Young Peopleâ€™s Right to Participation in Decision Making
- Youth, Gender & Diversity
- Youth, Innovation & Education
- Youth as Agents of Change
- Youth & Countering Violent Extremism
- Youth, Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) & HIV
- Youth & Migration.

The recommendations from these workgroups were developed into a final outcome document with recommendations on how young people wish to engage with the HRC. You can download this document here:
