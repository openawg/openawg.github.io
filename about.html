# About
openAWG is the open source[^0] atmospheric water generator[^1] which will serve as the centerpiece for “The Church of Water”, a water-conscious art installation at Burning Man 2016: DaVinci's Workshop.[^2] Our target is a daily water generation capacity of 1000L per day from the air above Black Rock City.

Atmospheric water generation is only the first module of our larger goal. Imagine a machine that not only distills water from thin air if you have none, but can also distill the contaminated water you do have, including urine.[^3] By continuing to pump heat from the air after the removal of water, it can also provide you with industrial gases such as nitrogen (gas/liquid), oxygen (gas/liquid), carbon dioxide (solid), argon (gas/liquid), hydrogen (gas, from the electrolysis of water),[^4] and other rare gases[^5] through a process called cryogenic distillation.[^6] [^7] This machine will also be able to process human waste to provide clean water and sterile fertilizer to the algaculture module which can produce food, fertilizer, bioplastics, chemical feedstock (raw material), and pharmaceuticals.[^8] [^9] The power module is able to supply the electricity required for these processes and more while also removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.[^10] [^11] [^12] [^13] [^14] Finally, this machine will also have a satellite uplink, wifi access point, and miniature datacenter to provide Internet connectivity and local processing capabilities, service deployment (community wikis, databases, media servers), data storage, and analysis.[^15]

This non-exhaustive collection of modules is our vision for Civilization-in-a-box, an open source and sustainable framework.
